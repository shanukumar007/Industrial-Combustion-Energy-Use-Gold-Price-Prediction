Statistical methods and machine learning techniques will be used to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends in energy consumption. 
Predictive models will be developed to forecast energy consumption and optimize energy efficiency in combustion processes. 
The data analyst will work closely with a team of experts in combustion technology and energy efficiency to develop and implement strategies for optimizing energy consumption. 
The project will require strong analytical skills, experience with statistical analysis and machine learning, and a solid understanding of industrial processes and combustion technology. The data analyst will be responsible for designing and implementing data collection and analysis processes, developing predictive models, and presenting findings to the project team and stakeholders.
